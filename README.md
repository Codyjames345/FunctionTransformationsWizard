# FunctionTransformationsWizard
Allows entry of an object and image function and returns the transformation steps required.


Function Transformations Wizard (FTWâ„¢) V1.2
created by Cody Lincoln with the supervision of Stack Overflow

The program asks for two user inputs - the object and image functions - and returns a list of steps required to transform the object into the image.
I started building this as a fun project but I would like to see it finished one day.

Instructions
- download transformationsWizard.py
- if you don't already have the Python RegEx library you can install that with "pip install regex" or "python -m pip install regex".
- get a Victory Royale in the popular third-person shooter game "Fortnite"
- run with any Python interpreter.

TODO
- add support for other function formats like 1/x and sin(x)
- add check for different powers
- more idiot-proofing
- simplify steps including variables
- fix RegEx matches
- allow no brackets in cases like x**2
- allow user entry of object function and transformation steps and return image function (V2 Update)
